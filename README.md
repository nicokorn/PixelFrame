# NRF52840_WS2812B_BLE
Firmware code for an pixel frame. It uses the nordic ble stack for bluetooth low energy capability. The firmware runs on a Nordic nRF52840 and uses the pwm peripheral to control ws2812b leds. The fds module is used to store and load peristent data from the internal flash. To control the pixel frame I also developed an Android App which is held in a seperate repo: LINK. The housing I have drawn in Autocad in several pieces and then 3D printed with pla filament.
